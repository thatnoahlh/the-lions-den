prompt:
hey mr copilot, im in my first 24 hour hackathon as a freshman studying computer science (c++). the theme is "mind matters: tech for mental health and well-being". could you help me code a program in my shared 'thatnoahlh/the-lions-den' repo in which the users of the website will all start with the same flower seed with which they plant in a pot and as they answer 10-20+ mental-health related questions the petals of the flower grow individually with different colors dependant on how they answer the question. is there a way to program a 3d environment with c++ where this element (the flower "game") and other elements (such as an interactive notebook and minigames) could be housed
